*   **Body:** (Visual: Quick cuts of tester wearing Bassbuds, seemingly oblivious to surroundings.  They walk into walls, almost spill coffee, etc., all while enjoying the music.

*   **Body:** (Visual: Fast cuts of the tester using Bassbuds throughout the week: commuting, working out, relaxing, etc., with a playful overlay showing remaining battery percentage each day -  it remains impressively high.)  "They said 40 hours.  They LIED.  It's way more!"

*   **Body:** (Visual: Short, funny clips showing those unexpected scenarios in action. Text Overlay: "Multi-functional earbuds?  Maybe.")  "But the sound?  Still amazing." (Quick cut back to the tester using the earbuds normally, looking very pleased)
