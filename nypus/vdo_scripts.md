# Theme: Software Testers Trolling Software Developers

## Scripts:

**Script 1: The "Bug Report"**

* **Hook:** (Visual: A tester dramatically pointing at a screen showing a minor UI glitch â€“ a button slightly misaligned.)  "Another critical bug discovered..."

* **Body:** (Fast-paced montage of increasingly ridiculous "bugs" â€“ a slightly off-color pixel, a missing comma in the help text, a loading screen with one frame displaying for a second too long)  "Priority 1:  The loading screen is 0.0003 seconds too slow. Priority 2: The 'Submit' button is 0.5 pixels to the left of its intended position.  Priority 3:  The error message font is not Arial."

* **Call to Action:** "What's the most ridiculous bug you've ever found?  Let us know in the comments! #softwaretesting #developerlife #bugs"


**Script 2: The "Unexpected Input"**

* **Hook:** (Visual: Tester typing seemingly random characters into a text field, then a shocked developer appears.) "We've got a new feature request..."

* **Body:**  (Short clips showing the tester entering unusual inputs:  Emoji spam,  a long string of random numbers and symbols,  entire paragraphs of Shakespeare, etc.  The developer's face grows increasingly distressed with each input.)  "Just testing the limits of your software... for quality assurance, of course.  ðŸ˜‰"

* **Call to Action:**  "What's the strangest input you've ever had to handle? Share your stories! #testinglife #codinghumor #softwaredeveloper"


**Script 3: "The 'Enhancement' Request"**

* **Hook:** (Visual: Tester presenting a ridiculously long, detailed "enhancement request" document with numerous unnecessary suggestions.) "We have a few... suggestions... to improve your masterpiece."

* **Body:** (Quick cuts showing absurd suggestions from the document: adding a blinking unicorn to the login screen, changing all the text to Comic Sans, implementing a built-in horoscope feature) "It's for the user experience... obviously."  (Developer's exasperated sigh)

* **Call to Action:** "What's the most outlandish feature request you've ever received?  Comment below!  #devlife #testersgonnarest #softwarehumor"
